## Confounder Logistic Model
`confounder.R` implements this. //needs to be updated yet

## Bayesian A/B Testing method
`1.py` implements the numerical procedure of finding required sample size.
  
`2.py` carries out simulation study to check the comparative performance of bayesian method and frequentist(aka classical) method. This was required mainly for the slides to get the comparison results.

`3.py` plots the outcome of a single conducted test in bayesian method.

`4.py` is a brief code for generating some plots for the slides.
